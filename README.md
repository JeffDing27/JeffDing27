## About Me
I’m a **junior full-stack web developer** with over a year of hands-on experience building real projects. I enjoy turning ideas into working applications and learning by building, debugging, and improving my code.

One project I’m especially proud of is an AI-powered flashcard app that converts long text into flashcards. I integrated Google AI APIs, implemented authentication with Clerk, deployed with Vercel, and used Firebase for data storage. Debugging deployment issues taught me a lot about real-world development, and I genuinely enjoyed the process.

I’ve worked with JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, React, and Next.js, and I’m comfortable deploying applications and managing domains. While I don’t have advanced CI/CD experience yet, I understand modern deployment workflows and continue to improve as I build more production-level projects.

I have hands-on experience building 30+ production websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, setting up domains and security with Cloudflare, and integrating third-party services such as Shopify, ShipStation, and inventory systems.

I’m always curious, open to learning new tools, and excited to keep building.

🎓 **Education**
- Associate Degree in Web Development (2024)
- B.S. in Software Engineering — starting January 2026
