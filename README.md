## About Me
I’m a junior full-stack web developer with over a year of hands-on experience building real projects. I enjoy turning ideas into working applications and learning by building, debugging, and improving my code.

One project I’m especially proud of is an AI-powered flashcard app that converts long text into flashcards. I integrated Google AI APIs, implemented authentication with Clerk, deployed with Vercel, and used Firebase for data storage. Debugging deployment issues taught me a lot about real-world development, and I genuinely enjoyed the process.

I’ve worked with JavaScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, React, and Next.js, and I’m comfortable deploying applications and managing domains. While I don’t have advanced CI/CD experience yet, I understand modern deployment workflows and continue to improve as I build more production-level projects.

I graduated with an Associate Degree in Web Development (2024) and will begin pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering in January 2026. My goal is to become a strong full-stack developer, with a growing focus on building AI-powered applications.

I’m always curious, open to learning new tools, and excited to keep building.
